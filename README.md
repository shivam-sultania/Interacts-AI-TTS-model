# Interacts-AI-TTS-model

I have tried to create this model for synthesis of a speech in an Indian language for which I have used AI4Bharat dataset and VITS arch. other than Hindi.

In this there are few important steps needed to be followed for running the program.

1. For creating the transcript file use the trial.py and valid dataset of tamil language from https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in/datasets/indicvoices.
2. Segeragate the audio and text file in different folders and add its directories to the program.
3. After creating the transcript file upload it to google drive and use the adress of that file to run the colab program.
4. There also needs to be a checkpoint folder created in the drive to run the program.
